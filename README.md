# Objective

1. This project investigates whether incorporating principles of Systems Thinking, inspired by Peter Senge's "Fifth Discipline," into LLM system instructions can produce higher-quality outputs than conventional, decomposition-based prompting. 

2. The central hypothesis is that by prompting a model to analyze moderately complex tasks holistically, we can elicit responses that demonstrate a deeper, more interconnected understanding of the problem. 

3. Through quantitative analysis, this study aims to measure this impact and develop a framework to predict the effectiveness of a prompt based on its structural and philosophical approach.
